<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>This is a very short project for a test run of the longer IGCSE project in Year 11. So I am using this time and chance to promote Pewdiepie, who is in desperate need of help.(This website was put together in about three hours so it's not perfect)</p>
<h3>What is our purpose?</h3>
<p>This website is to make merchandise promote Pewdiepie to our fellow internet users oblivious or neutral on the Pewdiepie vs T-Series issue to subscribe to Pewdiepie and unsubscribe from T-Series. It is needed because Pewdiepie is a symbol/icon of YouTube's individual content creators, which was its original audience when YouTube was created. Another reason why is to raise awareness against the act of sub-botting and corporate control on YouTube.</p>
<h3>How this website works</h3>
<p>This website has two pages: a home page (this one) and a products page where I introduce all of my products (10 in total). You can choose between the two pages by clicking on the navigation buttons in the header.</p>
